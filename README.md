# Drought-Data-Science-Project

Team Members: Chase Krogh, Jack Lei, Isaias Torres

Mapping of drought conditions in California by producing NDWI &amp; NDVI maps and analyzing them for correlations. Important variables will be precipitation, temperature, vegetation and additional geographic factors that contribute to a warming climate and reduced rainfall.

Problem Statement:
San Joaquin County has been in an emergency drought since April 21st, 2021. All Census blocks groups have been severly affected by extreme drought conditons in this county.

Questions:
-What insights can the analysis of NDWI, NDVI & EVI landsat imagery offer us regarding variations in drought conditons over time.
